## Use Case
Geo-redundant storage with the highest level of availability and performance is ideal for low-latency, high-QPS content serving to users distributed across geographic regions. Cloud Storage provides the availability and throughput needed to stream audio or video directly to apps or websites.

### 
Once you create a bucket and set a geographic location for storing your object data it is permanent  when you create a bucket. All Cloud Storage data is redundant across at least two zones within at least one geographic place as soon as you upload it.

When creating the cloud storage bucket you can specific whether the objects will be stored in a 
- region is a specific geographic place, such as SÃ£o Paulo.
- dual-region is a specific pair of regions, such as Tokyo and Osaka.
- multi-region is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that contains two or more geographic places.
